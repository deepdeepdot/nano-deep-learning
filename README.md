### Guide to Deep Learning for Teens in 6 Sessions

This course was prepared for the [Nanohacker](https://www.nanohackers.org/) community. Thanks to [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/locations/new-york) for hosting our sessions!

    $ git clone https://github.com/deepdeepdot/nano-deep-learning.git
    $ cd nano-deep-learning


If you have python 2.7

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer


If you have python 3

    $ python -m http.server


### Overview

It requires proficiency in a programming language, say Ruby or Javascript.
Also, it assumes knowledge of basic git commands and github.
We'll cover some computer science topics like trees, functional 
programming using Python, and classes in Python.

Prerequisites
* Experience with programming
* Full stack web development
